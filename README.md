### Objectives:

1. Create Graph class
2. Implement sequential BFS
3. Implement (simple) parallel BFS with CUDA
4. Implement Merill parallel BFS with CUDA "High-Performance and Scalable GPU Graph Traversal"
5. Call Gunrock library with BFS algorithms "Gunrock: a high-performance graph processing library on the GPU"
6. Performance comparison and conclusions
